# Beacons Microservice Downloads

Right now, the only way to get the microservice is to check it out directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pip-templates/pip-templates-microservice-dotnet.git
```

The Pip.Service team is working on implementing packaging, to make stable releases available as zip-downloadable archives.
